    <h1>Pythagorean Theorem</h1>
    <h2>A geometric harmony</h2>
    <p>
        The <b><i>Pythagorean Theorem</i></b> is a fundamental principle in geometry. It states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the <i>hypotenuse</i> (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides. Mathematically, it can be expressed as:
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>c<sup>2</sup> = a<sup>2</sup> + b<sup>2</sup></b>
    </p>
    <p>
        Here, <b>c</b> represents the length of the hypotenuse, while <b>a</b> and <b>b</b> are the lengths of the other two sides.
    </p>
    <p>
        This theorem is named after the ancient Greek mathematician <b>Pythagoras</b>, who made significant contributions to the field of mathematics.
